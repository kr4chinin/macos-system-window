# macOS System Window üíª

A simplified recreation of **macOS's** dark-themed **home screen**, featuring functional UI components and a special emphasis on the **system window**. This window is fully interactive, allowing users to effortlessly drag, resize, and utilize various other features typically found in native macOS window components.

## Introduction

Run the application 
```
npm install
npm start
```

The **main** **objective** of this project was to meticulously reverse-engineer one of macOS's most renowned interfaces, all without relying on any pre-existing templates. My aim was to preserve the core functionality of the user interface as faithfully as possible but simplify it where necessary.

Highlighted features of this project include:

* A **draggable** and **resizable** system window, which offers a pseudo full-screen mode, the ability to resize and hide the sidebar (automatically hidden when the modal reaches a certain minimal size, and restored upon returning to the normal size);
* Fold/unfold **directories**, choose different directories;

* Functional navbar with **dynamic** dropdown **content** options;

* Interactive controls for navigating back and forward within directories;
* Dock with informative tooltips. Clicking on the _Finder_ icon will reopen the modal if it was previously closed.
